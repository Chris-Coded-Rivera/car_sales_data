# car_sales_data

In this project I looked over a dataset of car sales, cleaned up the raw data and built a web application to display the data interactively. I included a couple plots to display a bit of insights.

It is meant to be a tool to showcase how web applications can be a useful tool for data science along with the libraries used to implement it.

You can launch this project on your local machine by forking this depository then launch a web application via  Render by connecting your github with the forked depository. Then, voila! You're running the app on your local machine or you can simply follow this render address that'll take you to the app: https://car-sales-data.onrender.com


ENJOY!
